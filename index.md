Hi! I'm Alex. I am a first-year master student following two programmes: Sustainable Energy Technology and Industrial Ecology.

1. Academic publications  
  a. Conference paper: Tow pull-up research https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mfglet.2024.03.011   
  b. Preprint journal paper: Tow pull-up research but better   


3. Projects  
  a. National energy system modeling: I led my group in designing a comprehensive model for China's energy generation and demand, optimizing to minimize capital expenditure for renewable infrastructure while accounting for factors such as demand response, curtailment, short- and long-term storage, and renewable variability. A specific area of focus was the representation of energy demand with a 15-minute resolution at province level, which I worked towards by combining estimations of sectoral load profiles and measurements of provincial yearly energy demand.  
  b. Tow pull-up research: Within my independent research project, I am combining experimental trials with analytical modeling to study defects during advanced composite manufacturing processes. This process involves a complete research cycle, from literature review, to experimental investigation and reporting, to simulations, verification and validation, and sensitivity studies. This project is part of a collaboration between TU Delft and industry, with regular information synthesis and reporting to stakeholders. Results of my work were presented at the 6th Symposium for Automated Composite Manufacturing in South Carolina.  
  c. Stratos V structural design and analysis: As a part-time engineer, I performed various tasks within the structural design process of the Stratos V student-designed launch vehicle. In addition to organizing workflows and timelines, I applied engineering skills to perform trade-offs, literature reviews, and detailed documentation. Moreover, I applied my technical know-how to program structural simulations and perform finite element analyses, all in the context of a team of 90 student engineers with strong teamwork and systems engineering.  

5. Writings: I currently write for Delta, TU Delft's independent news platform. I'm particularly interested in social and environmental issues and their connection to technology. I also wrote for the Leonardo Times, the journal of the TU Delft Faculty of Aerospace Engineering's study association, and for the Romanian platform Contributors.

6. Other activities    
  a. Board of Studies: Continuing my interest in education, I represented my fellow students within the official Board of Studies. My responsibilities included advising the Dean and educational coordinators on the current state, problems, and proposed solutions for the educational programmes at a bachelor and master level.   
  b. Student Ambassador: I helped organize our faculty's Open Day and Student for a Day events. During these events, I regularly gave presentations about studying at TU Delft and guide groups of up to 40 students through workshop and faculty tours.    
  c. Casa Buna: I worked with children from under-privileged backgrounds as a volunteer. I organized and supervised various practical activities during summer camps, and provided one-on-one academic support online and offline.  

7. Interests  
  a. Philosophy of identity: profilicity and performativity  
  b. Systems thinking  
  c. Sustainability  
  d. Political economy
